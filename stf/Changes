Changes
=======

2.00 - Oct 12, 2012
    * Storages are now grouped into Storage Clusters. You need at least
      3 storages per cluster. When a write occurs, you must be able to
      write to at least 3 storages in order for the write to be successful.
      If a write to a cluster fails, other clusters are tried until success.
      A PUT operation returns failure if and only if writes to all clusters
      fail.
    * Worker Drones are now able to self-balance the number of workers that
      each drone is supposed to spawn. You can set the global number of
      worker instances by setting variables in the 'config' table in the
      database.
    * Workers can now be throttled.
    * Admin interface now allows you to set some global config variables
      without having to muck with the database.
    * Repairs can now take place without having to delete the entities in
      the targeted storage. Previously we blindly assumed that the
      storage was inaccessible and therefore all entities are lost, so
      you could only delete the (logical) entities there.
      Now you can choose to specify "needs repair" which will assume that
      the target is READABLE but not writable for repair, so you can
      basically keep entities that are intact, or you can choose to set
      "crashed (needs repair)", which will skip checking for entities
      in that storage, and will simply migrate away what it can.
    * ObjectHealth worker is now deprecated.
    * RecoverCrash worker is now deprecated.
    * RetireStorage worker is now deprecated.
    * Added stf-recover-object-disk, a tool to recover objects directly
      from a file on disk.
    * Added stf-repair-cluster, a tool to manually repair objects in a
      cluster.
    * Added stf-repair-degraded-objects, a tool to selectively look for
      objects that have less than 3 entities and put them into the
      repair queue.
    * Added support for Redis and Resque message queues.
    * Removed STF::Migrator and STF::Stress under ext/ (actually, they probably
      don't work right now, anyway)
    * Output generated with STF_DEBUG is now much better thanks to
      Log::Minimal
    * Fixed a bug in the Q4M worker that caused jobs at the very end of the
      loop to be lost.
    * Fixed cache mechanism in various places either to make fetches
      faster or to forcefully update necessary fields.
    * Fixed 32-bit support by using Bit::Vector et al.
    * Removed unecessary Perl module dependency.
    * Changed to use Mouse as the class builder.
    * Changed to check for object sizes upon repair.
