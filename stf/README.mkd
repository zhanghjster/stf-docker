# STF - Scalable, Simple Distributed Object Storage

STF is a distributed object store (similar to MogileFS), which allows you to store billions of files on commodity hardware/software stack. It was developed at <a href="http://www.livedoor.com">livedoor Inc</a>, initially as sets of Apache modules, then eventually was ported to a native PSGI application.

Among other things, it currently handles traffic for one of Japan's busiest blogging service, chugging 400Mbps of datas.

STF is built on top of long trusted software like Apache (or nginx), Perl, Q4M (or TheSchwartz, Resque, Redis), MySQL, and Memcached, with open protocols so it's easy to maintain.

## UPGRADING 

### DATABASE SCHEMA

If you were running STF 1.x, you must change your database schema:

    # IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU TEST THIS BEFORE
    # RUNNING IT AGAINST A PRODUCTION DATABASE
    # -- you've been warned

    mysql stf ... < misc/stf-1.x-to-2.x.sql

### WORKER SELF-BALANCING

Since version 2.00, STF workers control the number of instances that should
be fork+exec'ed on each drone: e.g. if you had 3 drones, and you set the
config variable stf.drone.RepairObject.instances to 20, drones will spawn
6, 6, and 8 RepairObject workers.

Thus the old setting in your config.pl will no longer be respected.

### CLUSTERED STORAGE

Since version 2.00, STF requires that you setup your storage in "clusters".

First you need to create clusters, and add storages to it. You can set this
via the new admin interface, or by manual operation.

    INSERT INTO storage_cluster ...;
    UPDATE storage SET cluster_id = ... WHERE id = ...;

There is no constraint from the system as to how many storages you should put 
in a cluster, but in order to keep your data safe, you MUST have at least
three storages per cluster. You also should have at least two clusters, but
three or more is recommended.

## Travis CI

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/stf-storage/stf.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/stf-storage/stf)

## Get STF

    git clone git://github.com/stf-storage/stf.git
    cd stf
    cpanm --installdeps .

## Setup

Please read http://stf-storage.github.com/setup.html

## Very simple usage via lwp-request

    # create a bucket
    lwp-request -m PUT http://stf-host/bucket
    Please enter content (text/plain) to be PUTed:
    # (Press Ctrl+D here so you don't send any content)

    # create an object
    lwp-request -m PUT http://stf-host/bucket/object
    Please enter content (text/plain) to be PUTed:
    # Type in random stuff here to be sent to the server

    # get the object
    lwp-request http://stf-host/bucket/object

    # delete the object
    lwp-request -m DELETE http://stf-host/bucket/object
